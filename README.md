# APT - Asset Pricing Theory

Project for Asset Pricing Theory course.

## Geometric Brownian motion

In this project I use *geometric Brownian motion* to simulate a stock price a year in advance.

Data was aquired from [nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/). For the project I choose the stock of [Pfizer, Inc. Common Stock](https://www.pfizer.com/) as the company is very relevant in this covid times.
